## New
- Added Side Panel
  - Switched the design editing interface from a modal to a side panel.
  - The default display for settings windows created using `defineElement` and `defineSettings` has been changed from a modal to a side panel. The existing modal style is still supported via the `settingUI` value. [Related Docs](https://dmnote.app/docs/declarative-api/)
  - Added canvas editing features
    - You can now reorder elements or toggle their visibility by dragging them in the Layers tab.
    - Moved the existing `Other Settings - Grid Settings` to the Grid tab and added new settings to control grid snap size and toggle the minimap.

- Added Multi-Edit Feature
  - You can now select multiple keys at once and edit them collectively.

- Added Key Customization Features
  - Added the ability to edit key background color, border color, border thickness, corner radius, text, font size, font color, and font style without CSS. Enabling "Prioritize Inline Styles" ensures these settings take precedence over conflicting CSS.
  - Added the ability to set the width and corner radius of individual notes.
  - Added the ability to edit the font size and font style of counters without CSS.

- Global Note Settings Changes
  - The corner radius setting has been moved to individual key settings.
  - Added a `None` option to the Fade settings.

- Added Shortcut Settings
  - Added the ability to configure the program's main shortcuts. This is located under the Language settings.
  - You can right-click a shortcut button to unbind it.

## Fix
- Changed some default settings

## Etc
- Performance optimizations and improvements to some design elements
- The program now automatically applies the browser's language setting upon first launch.
- A bug was discovered in Microsoft Edge Runtime 145.x and later where transparent overlays appear gray or white. As this bug severely impacts program usability, an older version of the WebView2 runtime has been temporarily embedded in the program files, resulting in an increased file size. Once the WebView2 issue is resolved, we will switch back to the previous method in the next minor update, reducing the file size. [Related Issue](https://github.com/DmNote-App/DmNote/issues/20)
