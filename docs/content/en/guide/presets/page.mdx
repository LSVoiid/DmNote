2. Execute **Export Preset** from the main window toolbar.
3. Select a save location and a `preset.json` file will be created.

## Importing Presets

1. Execute **Import Preset** from the main window toolbar.
2. Select a previously saved preset `.json` file.
3. The imported settings will be applied immediately.

<Callout type="warning">

  backup if needed.
</Callout>
