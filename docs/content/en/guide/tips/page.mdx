In some games' fullscreen mode, the overlay may not work properly.

**Solutions:**

- Or select **windowed mode** in game settings.

### Overlay Placement Tips

To place the overlay over the game screen:

1. Enable the **Always on top** option.
2. Move the overlay to the desired position.
3. Enable the **Lock overlay window** option.

### Capturing Game and Overlay Together

To capture both game and overlay at once:

Copying this entire folder backs up all settings, presets, and plugin data.
