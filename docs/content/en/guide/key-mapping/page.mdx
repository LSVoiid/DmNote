# Key Mapping

Key mapping is the core feature of the key viewer. You can set which keyboard key to assign to each key.

## Key Mode Selection

Select a key mode from the dropdown menu at the top:

- **4key**: 4 keys (rhythm game standard)
- **5key**: 5 keys
- **6key**: 6 keys
- **8key**: 8 keys

Each mode has independent settings, and previous settings are preserved when switching modes.

## Adding Keys

1. **Right-click** on an empty space in the grid.
2. Select **Add Key** from the menu.
3. Click the newly created key and enter the keyboard key to map.

## Removing Keys

1. **Right-click** on the key to remove.
2. Select **Delete Key** from the menu.

## Changing Key Mapping

1. **Click** on the key to change.
2. When the modal appears, **press the keyboard key** you want to map.
3. The modal will close automatically when mapping is complete.
